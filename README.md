# Project: Building a RESTful API

TODO: Add project image

TODO: Add link to a live demo

**Current Version:** 0.0.2

## Description:

The goal of this project is to practice building a RESTful API.

Although i've built one before, I thought it would be good practice to create
another one.

So, I intend to create a small javascript project that utilizes node.js and
express as its backend.

**Note:** Postman was used to test the routing of this application.

If you're new to the backend, Postman is a great little application that enables
developers to make test requests to their server.

To get started with Postman, you can visit their site and download it.

### Why do we need an Postman to make test requests?

Well the address bar of your browser (ie. Google chrome) only allows you to make
GET requests. This is great when you simply need to fetch information **from**
your server.

However, when you want to test other CRUD functionality, you will need to make
other types of requests. This is what's great about the Postman application.

As I said earlier, it allows your to make other types of requests to your
server.

Thanks Postman.
