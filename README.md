# Project: Building a RESTful API

TODO: Add project image

TODO: Add link to a live demo

**Current Version:** 0.0.1

## Description:

The goal of this project is to practice building a RESTful API.

Although i've built one before, I thought it would be good practice to create
another one.

So, I intend to create a small javascript project that utilizes node.js and
express as its backend.

### Stack:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Version History:

**Version 0.0.1:**

Created an express server as the basic backend of the site.
